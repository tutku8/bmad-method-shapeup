# MW 2.0 - Integrated Maintenance Communication PRD

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals
- Increase MW adoption from 10.7% to >20% of paying users within 6 months
- Eliminate friction in maintenance communication workflows by integrating MW and announcement creation
- Provide accurate "Paused for Maintenance" status indicators during planned maintenance periods
- Reduce support tickets related to maintenance confusion by 40%
- Decrease time-to-communicate maintenance from 15 minutes to <2 minutes

### Background Context
MW 2.0 addresses the #2 most requested feature (per Nolt feedback) by solving the core friction point where users must separately manage maintenance windows and announcements, leading to poor adoption (only 10.7% of paying users). The enhancement integrates these workflows using a template-based approach while providing clear "Paused for Maintenance" status indicators that accurately represent system state during planned maintenance, avoiding complex synchronization that would exceed appetite constraints.

## Requirements

### Functional

**FR1:** The system shall provide smart announcement creation during MW setup, displaying "☑️ Notify PSP subscribers (recommended)" checkbox only when selected monitors have active PSPs with subscribers.

**FR2:** The system shall create announcements with pre-filled MW details (timing, affected services) when notification checkbox is selected, allowing user customization of title and description before completion.

**FR3:** The system shall automatically publish linked announcements when maintenance windows start and unpublish them when maintenance windows end, with no ongoing synchronization after creation.

**FR4:** The system shall display distinct "Paused for Maintenance" status on PSP status bars using separate status tables during active maintenance windows.

**FR5:** The system shall show "Paused for Maintenance" status in dashboard monitor details during active maintenance windows.

**FR6:** The system shall send email notifications to PSP subscribers using existing announcement email infrastructure when MW-created announcements are published.

**FR7:** The system shall allow users to manually mark maintenance windows as "Done" before scheduled end time with confirmation dialog.

**FR8:** The system shall automatically mark non-recurring maintenance windows as "Done" when scheduled end time is reached.

**FR9:** The system shall visually group maintenance windows by status: Active (happening now), Scheduled (upcoming), and Completed (past).

**FR10:** The system shall allow Editors to create, edit, and manage maintenance windows and create announcements during MW setup.

**FR11:** The system shall allow users to select timezone during maintenance window creation, defaulting to their account timezone.

**FR12:** The system shall allow users to manually unpublish MW-linked announcements before MW completion through the announcement management interface, providing immediate control over subscriber communication.

### Non Functional

**NFR1:** Enhancement must maintain existing MW and announcement functionality without breaking changes to current workflows.

**NFR2:** PSP status indicator changes must not impact PSP page load performance by more than 100ms.

**NFR3:** Email notifications must integrate with existing subscriber management without requiring new email infrastructure.

**NFR4:** New status indicators must be visually distinct and accessible (WCAG AA compliance maintained).

**NFR5:** MW completion tracking must include audit logging (who marked done, when) for operational transparency.

**NFR6:** Smart PSP detection must not add more than 200ms to MW creation form load time.

### Compatibility Requirements

**CR1:** Existing MW creation and management workflows must continue to function unchanged for users who don't use announcement integration.

**CR2:** Current announcement system functionality must remain fully operational independent of MW integration.

**CR3:** PSP status display must maintain backward compatibility with existing status page themes and customizations.

**CR4:** Email notification system must work with existing PSP subscriber preferences and unsubscribe mechanisms.

## User Interface Design Goals

### Overall UX Vision
Transform maintenance window creation from an isolated utility into an integrated communication workflow that naturally guides users toward best practices (notifying subscribers) without overwhelming them with complexity.

**Enhancement Integration Strategy:** Extend existing MW and announcement services rather than creating new microservices, maintaining current architecture while adding new status tables for clean separation.

### Testing Requirements
**Unit + Integration Testing:** Comprehensive testing essential due to cross-system integration (MW, announcements, PSP, email) to prevent regressions in existing functionality.

### Additional Technical Assumptions and Requests

**Database Strategy:**
- Extend existing MW tables with optional announcement relationship fields
- Create separate "maintenance_status" table for "Paused for Maintenance" states
- Leverage existing PSP-monitor relationship data for smart contextual display
- Maintain existing announcement and email subscriber table structures

**Email Integration:**
- Utilize existing PSP subscriber notification infrastructure and templates
- Piggyback on current announcement email delivery system
- No new email service dependencies or infrastructure changes required

**Frontend Integration:**
- Extend existing MW creation UI components with smart announcement section
- Add new status indicators to existing PSP rendering system using separate status logic
- Maintain current responsive design patterns and PSP theme compatibility

**API Compatibility:**
- Maintain existing MW API endpoints for backward compatibility
- Extend MW creation APIs with optional announcement parameters
- Ensure existing MW management tools and integrations continue to function unchanged

**Performance Constraints:**
- Smart PSP detection must not add >200ms to MW form load time
- PSP status rendering must not add >100ms to status page load times
- MW creation workflow should not significantly increase form submission time

**Security and Permissions:**
