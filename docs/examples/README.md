# Shape Up Examples

This directory contains example artifacts created using the Shape Up workflow integration.

## Example Files

### MW 2.0 - Maintenance Window Enhancement
- `mw-2-0-final-pitch.md` - Complete Shape Up pitch following the methodology
- `mw-2-0-prd.md` - Traditional BMad PRD (for comparison)
- `mw-2-0-shape-up-pitch.md` - Intermediate Shape Up pitch format
- `mw-2-0-project-brief.md` - Analysis foundation document

### How These Were Created

The MW 2.0 examples demonstrate the complete Shape Up workflow:

1. **Started with appetite**: 120 hours (3 weeks, 1 person)
2. **Problem validation**: #2 most requested feature with low adoption
3. **Business analysis**: Stakeholder impact and success metrics
4. **Fat marker sketches**: High-level solution without over-prescription
5. **Deliverability assessment**: Scope aligned with appetite
6. **Final pitch**: Ready for betting table consideration

### Key Learnings from MW 2.0

- **Appetite discipline worked**: Original estimate was 260 hours, shaped down to ~70 hours
- **Circuit breakers were essential**: Email complexity could have blown appetite
- **Fat marker sketches preserved autonomy**: Developers have implementation flexibility
- **Business focus helped**: Clear stakeholder impact and success metrics
- **No-gos were crucial**: Explicit boundaries prevented scope creep

## Using These Examples

### For Learning
- Study the progression from problem to final pitch
- See how appetite constraints shaped the solution
- Understand the role distribution across agents
- Compare traditional BMad vs Shape Up outputs

### As Templates
- Use the structure for your own Shape Up pitches
- Adapt the format to your specific domain
- Reference the agent role distribution
- Follow the methodology compliance patterns

### For Validation
- Check your pitches against these examples
- Ensure appetite discipline is maintained
- Verify developer autonomy is preserved
- Confirm circuit breakers are realistic

## Creating Your Own Examples

To create new examples using the Shape Up workflow:

```bash
*workflow shape-up-planning
```

Follow the agent guidance and produce similar artifacts for your domain.

## Example Comparison

| Aspect | Traditional BMad (PRD) | Shape Up Edition (Pitch) |
|--------|------------------------|--------------------------|
| **Length** | 268 lines | 138 lines |
| **Focus** | Complete specifications | Appetite-constrained direction |
| **Solution Detail** | Technical architecture | Fat marker sketches |
| **Developer Guidance** | Prescriptive implementation | Preserved autonomy |
| **Risk Management** | Risk identification | Circuit breakers |
| **Business Context** | Requirements focus | Outcome focus |

Both approaches have value - choose based on your needs:
- **Use Shape Up** for exploration, betting table decisions, appetite-constrained planning
- **Use Traditional BMad** for detailed implementation, compliance requirements, fixed specifications
