# Project Brief: MW 2.0 - Maintenance Window Enhancement

**Session Date:** September 18, 2025  
**Facilitator:** Business Analyst Mary  
**Participant:** Product Team  

## Executive Summary

MW 2.0 enhances UptimeRobot's maintenance window functionality to address the #2 most requested feature: better maintenance communication. The project focuses on integrating maintenance windows with announcements and providing clear "Paused for Maintenance" status indicators. Current adoption is low (10.7% of paying users) due to poor communication workflows and confusing status displays during maintenance.

**Target Outcome:** Increase MW adoption to >20% of paying users by making maintenance communication effortless and status displays accurate.

## Problem Statement

**Current State Pain Points:**
- Maintenance information is poorly communicated to users (2nd top requested feature)
- Announcements and maintenance windows are managed separately, causing inefficiency
- Status pages show "Up" during maintenance, which is misleading to end-users
- Users must manually create separate announcements for each maintenance window
- No clear visual distinction between maintenance vs actual downtime

**Impact Quantification:**
- Only 10.7% of paying users adopt maintenance windows
- 92.2% of churned users never used the feature
- Poor communication leads to support tickets and lost trust
- Status page credibility is undermined when showing "Up" during planned maintenance

**Why Existing Solutions Fall Short:**
- Decoupled announcement creation creates friction
- No maintenance-specific status indicators
- Manual processes discourage adoption
- Inconsistent timezone handling across features

## Proposed Solution

**Core Concept:** Integrate maintenance window creation with announcement publishing and introduce clear "Paused for Maintenance" status indicators across all user-facing surfaces.

**Key Differentiators:**
- **Seamless Integration:** Create announcements directly during MW setup
- **Clear Status Communication:** Distinct maintenance status vs downtime
- **Automated Workflows:** Reduce manual announcement management
- **Consistent Experience:** Unified timezone and permission handling

**High-Level Vision:**
Transform maintenance windows from a rarely-used feature into an essential tool that enhances rather than complicates user communication workflows.

## MVP Scope

### Core Features (Must Have)
- **PSP Status Enhancement:** "Paused for Maintenance" status with distinct visual indicators on status pages and dashboard
- **MW-Announcement Integration:** Create announcements directly during MW creation/editing with auto-publish/unpublish
- **Basic Email Automation:** Auto-send email to PSP subscribers when MW starts (not advance scheduling)
- **Manual MW Completion:** "Mark as Done" functionality with immediate status restoration
- **MW Status Grouping:** Visual separation of active, scheduled, and completed maintenance windows
- **Editor Permissions:** Allow Editors to create/manage MW and announcements
- **Basic Timezone Selection:** User can choose timezone for MW creation

### Out of Scope for MVP
- Advance email scheduling ("X hours before MW starts")
- Recurring MW email automation and complex scheduling
- Cross-system timezone reconciliation (defer to future)
- Bulk announcement management for recurring MW
- Advanced email preference management
- PSP upcoming maintenance window lists

### MVP Success Criteria
Successfully deliver core maintenance communication workflow that eliminates the need for separate announcement creation while providing accurate status indicators during maintenance periods.
