## Contribution Guidelines

### Shape Up Principles Compliance

All contributions must maintain Shape Up methodology compliance:

- ‚úÖ **Appetite drives scope** (not the reverse)
- ‚úÖ **Fat marker sketches** preserve implementation flexibility
- ‚úÖ **Circuit breakers** protect against scope creep
- ‚úÖ **Developer autonomy** maintained in technical decisions
- ‚úÖ **Problem-first approach** with evidence-based validation

### BMad Method Compatibility

Contributions must preserve BMad Method capabilities:

- ‚úÖ **Existing workflows** continue to function
- ‚úÖ **Agent roles** remain compatible with traditional BMad
- ‚úÖ **IDE integration** works with existing tooling
- ‚úÖ **Web environment** compatibility maintained

### Code Quality Standards

#### Workflow Files (.yaml)
- Follow existing YAML structure and formatting
- Include comprehensive agent guidance
- Provide clear handoff prompts
- Document decision points and conditions

#### Template Files (.yaml)

- Include clear instructions for each section
- Support interactive elicitation
- Maintain output format consistency

#### Documentation (.md)
