# Shape Up Pitch Validation Checklist

This checklist ensures Shape Up pitches follow methodology principles and are ready for betting table consideration.

[[LLM: SHAPE UP PITCH VALIDATION

This checklist validates Shape Up methodology compliance:

1. Appetite-First Planning - Appetite drives solution, not vice versa
2. Fat Marker Sketching - Solution provides direction without over-specification  
3. Circuit Breaker Integration - Stopping triggers protect appetite
4. Developer Autonomy - Technical decisions left to implementation team
5. Problem-Solution Fit - Solution clearly addresses defined problem within appetite

VALIDATION APPROACH:
- Evidence-Based: Cite specific pitch sections
- Methodology Compliance: Ensure Shape Up principles followed
- Appetite Discipline: Validate scope protection mechanisms
- Developer Freedom: Ensure technical autonomy preserved]]

## 1. PROBLEM DEFINITION

### 1.1 Problem Clarity
- [ ] Raw problem statement with specific user pain
- [ ] Affected users clearly identified with frequency/impact
- [ ] Current workarounds documented with costs
- [ ] Evidence from user feedback, analytics, or support data
- [ ] Business impact clearly articulated

### 1.2 Appetite Justification
- [ ] Appetite clearly defined (weeks, people, hours)
- [ ] Problem significance justifies appetite investment
- [ ] Alternative appetite levels considered
- [ ] Business point of view supports appetite decision

## 2. SOLUTION SKETCHING

### 2.1 Fat Marker Approach
- [ ] Solution provides direction without technical prescription
- [ ] High-level user flows identified without implementation details
- [ ] Core elements defined without constraining developer choices
- [ ] Solution clearly fits within appetite constraints

### 2.2 Developer Autonomy
- [ ] Technical implementation decisions left to developers
- [ ] Database design choices not prescribed
- [ ] UI/UX implementation approaches not mandated
- [ ] Performance optimization strategies not specified
- [ ] Testing approaches left to developer judgment

## 3. SCOPE DISCIPLINE

### 3.1 Boundaries and No-Gos
- [ ] Explicit exclusions clearly defined
- [ ] Scope protection mechanisms established
- [ ] Features to resist adding during implementation identified
- [ ] Future considerations documented for later cycles

### 3.2 Circuit Breakers
- [ ] Specific complexity triggers defined with thresholds
- [ ] Actionable stopping points with clear decision criteria
- [ ] Alternative approaches if circuit breakers are hit
- [ ] Appetite protection mechanisms built into implementation guidance

## 4. SUCCESS MEASUREMENT

### 4.1 Leading and Lagging Indicators
- [ ] Lagging indicators measure ultimate business outcomes
- [ ] Leading indicators provide early success signals
- [ ] Hypothesis clearly states expected cause-and-effect relationship
- [ ] Evaluation approach defined for measuring success

### 4.2 Target Setting
- [ ] Preliminary targets set with baseline comparisons
- [ ] Targets are measurable and time-bound
- [ ] Success criteria enable validation without prescribing implementation
- [ ] Metrics focus on user outcomes, not technical outputs

## 5. BETTING TABLE READINESS

### 5.1 Pitch Completeness
- [ ] Problem clearly justifies appetite investment
- [ ] Solution sketch provides adequate guidance without constraints
- [ ] Circuit breakers protect against complexity explosion
- [ ] Success criteria enable outcome validation
- [ ] Risks identified with mitigation strategies

### 5.2 Methodology Compliance
- [ ] Follows Shape Up methodology principles throughout
- [ ] Appetite discipline maintained in all sections
- [ ] Developer autonomy preserved in solution approach
- [ ] Ready for betting table consideration and commitment decision

## VALIDATION SUMMARY

[[LLM: SHAPE UP PITCH VALIDATION REPORT

Generate comprehensive validation report:

1. Methodology Compliance Score (percentage)
2. Appetite Discipline Assessment (Strong/Medium/Weak)
3. Developer Autonomy Preservation (Yes/No with details)
4. Circuit Breaker Effectiveness (Realistic/Optimistic/Insufficient)
5. Betting Table Readiness (Ready/Needs Work/Not Ready)

Identify:
- Critical gaps that block betting table consideration
- Methodology violations that need correction
- Over-specification areas that constrain developers
- Under-specification areas that need more guidance

Final recommendation: GO/NO-GO for betting table]]

### Category Statuses

| Category | Status | Critical Issues |
|----------|---------|----------------|
| 1. Problem Definition | _TBD_ | |
| 2. Solution Sketching | _TBD_ | |
| 3. Scope Discipline | _TBD_ | |
| 4. Success Measurement | _TBD_ | |
| 5. Betting Table Readiness | _TBD_ | |

### Final Decision

- **READY FOR BETTING TABLE**: Pitch follows Shape Up methodology and is ready for commitment decision
- **NEEDS REFINEMENT**: Pitch requires adjustments to methodology compliance or appetite discipline
- **NOT READY**: Pitch violates Shape Up principles and needs significant revision
