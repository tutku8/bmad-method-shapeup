# Create Shape Up Pitch Task

## Purpose

Create a comprehensive Shape Up pitch that follows the methodology principles of appetite-first planning, fat marker solution sketches, and developer autonomy preservation.

## Task Instructions

### 1. Appetite-First Validation

**CRITICAL:** Before any solution exploration, validate the appetite investment:

**Appetite Assessment:**
- [ ] Appetite clearly defined (weeks, people, total hours)
- [ ] Problem significance justifies appetite investment
- [ ] Alternative appetite levels considered (smaller/larger investment)
- [ ] Appetite constraints will drive all solution decisions

### 2. Problem Shaping

**Problem Definition Requirements:**
- [ ] Raw problem statement with specific user pain
- [ ] Affected user segments identified with frequency/impact
- [ ] Current workarounds documented with costs
- [ ] Evidence from user feedback, support tickets, or analytics
- [ ] Business impact of not solving clearly articulated

**Problem Validation:**
- [ ] Problem is worth the proposed appetite investment
- [ ] Problem is specific enough to guide solution development
- [ ] Problem has measurable user and business impact

### 3. Fat Marker Solution Sketching

**Solution Sketch Requirements:**
- [ ] High-level approach without technical prescription
- [ ] Key user flows and interactions identified
- [ ] Core elements that must exist defined
- [ ] Solution clearly fits within appetite constraints
- [ ] Technical implementation decisions left to developers

**CRITICAL:** Avoid over-specification. Provide direction, not detailed requirements.

### 4. Boundary and Risk Definition

**No-Go Definition:**
- [ ] Explicit exclusions that protect appetite
- [ ] Features to resist adding during implementation
- [ ] Scope protection mechanisms clearly defined
- [ ] Future considerations documented for later cycles

**Circuit Breaker Definition:**
- [ ] Specific complexity triggers that should stop work
- [ ] Actionable stopping points with clear thresholds
- [ ] Alternative approaches if circuit breakers are hit
- [ ] Appetite protection mechanisms built into implementation

### 5. Success Criteria and Analytics

**Success Definition:**
- [ ] Clear definition of what "done" looks like
- [ ] Measurable outcomes without prescribing implementation
- [ ] User behavior changes expected
- [ ] Business metrics that validate success

**Leading/Lagging Indicators:**
- [ ] Lagging indicators measure ultimate business outcomes
- [ ] Leading indicators provide early success signals
- [ ] Hypothesis clearly states expected cause-and-effect
- [ ] Evaluation approach defined for measuring success
- [ ] Preliminary targets set with baseline comparisons

### 6. Developer Autonomy Validation

**Technical Decision Freedom:**
- [ ] Database design decisions left to developers
- [ ] UI/UX implementation approaches not prescribed
- [ ] Performance optimization strategies not mandated
- [ ] Testing approaches left to developer judgment
- [ ] Error handling patterns not over-specified

**Implementation Flexibility:**
- [ ] Multiple technical approaches possible within solution sketch
- [ ] Developers can choose frameworks and patterns
- [ ] Solution sketch guides outcomes, not methods
- [ ] Trade-off decisions clearly identified for developer choice

### 7. Betting Table Preparation

**Pitch Completeness:**
- [ ] Problem clearly justifies appetite investment
- [ ] Solution sketch provides adequate guidance without constraints
- [ ] Circuit breakers protect against complexity explosion
- [ ] Success criteria enable validation of outcomes
- [ ] Risks identified with mitigation strategies

**Final Validation:**
- [ ] Pitch follows Shape Up methodology principles
- [ ] Appetite discipline maintained throughout
- [ ] Developer autonomy preserved
- [ ] Ready for betting table consideration

## Output Requirements

The final pitch must include:
- **Problem section** with user evidence and business impact
- **Solution section** with goals, details, and out-of-scope boundaries
- **Analytics section** with leading/lagging indicators and targets
- **Circuit breakers** integrated throughout for appetite protection
- **Developer autonomy** preserved through fat marker sketching

## Success Criteria

A successful Shape Up pitch:
1. Clearly defines a user problem worth the appetite investment
2. Provides solution direction without technical over-specification
3. Includes actionable circuit breakers that protect appetite
4. Preserves developer technical decision-making autonomy
5. Defines measurable success criteria for validation
6. Is ready for betting table consideration and commitment
