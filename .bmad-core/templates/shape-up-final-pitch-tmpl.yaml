    title: "# Problem"
    agent: analyst
    instruction: |
      Define the raw problem with user evidence. Validate appetite against problem significance.

      - Who experiences this and how often? (affected user segments)
      - Current workarounds and their costs
      - Why this problem justifies the appetite investment
