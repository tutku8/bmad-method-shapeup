  description: Interactive template for Shape Up discovery with appetite setting
  output_file: docs/working/discovery-analysis.md
  mode: interactive

sections:
  - id: header
    title: Discovery Analysis
    instruction: Create header with project name and date
    elicit: false

  - id: raw_idea
    title: Raw Idea & Initial Problem Statement
    instruction: |
      Work with user to articulate their raw idea and initial problem perception.
      Ask clarifying questions about what they're seeing and why it matters.
      Capture the unrefined problem statement before analysis.
    elicit: true
    rationale_focus: 
      - What assumptions are we making about the problem?
      - How well-defined is the user's initial perception?
      - What areas need deeper exploration?

  - id: current_state
    title: Current State Analysis
    instruction: |
      Collaboratively analyze the current state of the product/system in this area.
      Explore what exists today, how users currently handle this, and what's broken.
      Document current user workflows and pain points.
    elicit: true
    rationale_focus:
      - What evidence do we have about current state?
      - Are we making assumptions about user behavior?
      - What current workarounds exist and why?

  - id: problem_validation
    title: Problem Validation with Evidence
    instruction: |
      Work together to validate the problem with concrete evidence.
      Look for support tickets, user feedback, competitive analysis, metrics.
      Distinguish between perceived problems and validated problems.
    elicit: true
    rationale_focus:
      - How strong is our evidence for this problem?
      - What evidence are we missing?
      - Could this be a symptom of a deeper issue?

  - id: stakeholder_impact
    title: Stakeholder Impact Analysis
    instruction: |
      Identify who is affected by this problem and how.
      Consider different user types, internal teams, and business stakeholders.
      Quantify impact where possible.
    elicit: true
    rationale_focus:
      - Are we considering all affected stakeholders?
      - How do we prioritize different stakeholder needs?
      - What's the business impact if we don't solve this?

  - id: appetite_setting
    title: Appetite Definition
    instruction: |
      Work with user to define realistic appetite for this problem.
      Consider problem significance, business impact, and available resources.
      Set clear time boundaries (1-2 weeks, 6 weeks, etc.).
      Explain appetite in Shape Up terms - what we're willing to spend, not estimates.
    elicit: true
    rationale_focus:
      - Is this appetite realistic for the problem size?
      - What are we saying no to with this appetite?
      - How does this appetite compare to similar past projects?

  - id: circuit_breakers
    title: Circuit Breakers & Risk Factors
    instruction: |
      Identify potential complexity traps and rabbit holes.
      Define circuit breakers that would trigger scope cutting.
      Consider technical risks, integration challenges, and scope creep areas.
    elicit: true
    rationale_focus:
      - What could cause this project to exceed appetite?
      - Are our circuit breakers specific enough to be actionable?
      - What risks are we not seeing?

  - id: success_criteria
    title: Success Criteria & Definition of Done
    instruction: |
      Define what success looks like for this problem.
      Create measurable criteria that align with appetite.
      Distinguish between must-have and nice-to-have outcomes.
    elicit: true
    rationale_focus:
      - Are our success criteria measurable?
      - Do they align with our appetite constraints?
      - What are we explicitly not measuring?

  - id: competitive_context
    title: Competitive & Market Context
    instruction: |
      Analyze how competitors handle this problem.
      Identify competitive advantages or disadvantages.
      Consider market expectations and user comparisons.
    elicit: false
    rationale_focus:
      - How does this position us competitively?
      - Are we trying to match competitors or differentiate?

  - id: recommendations
    title: Recommendations for Solution Phase
    instruction: |
      Provide recommendations for the solution phase based on discovery.
      Highlight key constraints, opportunities, and focus areas.
      Note any assumptions that need validation during solution design.
    elicit: true
    rationale_focus:
      - What are the most important insights for solution design?
      - What constraints should guide the solution approach?
      - Where do we need to be most careful about scope?
