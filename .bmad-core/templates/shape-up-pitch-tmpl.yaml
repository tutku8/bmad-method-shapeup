workflow:
  mode: interactive
  elicitation: advanced-elicitation

sections:
  - id: problem
    title: Problem
    instruction: |
      Define the raw problem with user evidence. This is the foundation of Shape Up - start with the problem, not the solution.
      
      Focus on:
      - What problem are we solving? (specific user pain)
      - Who experiences this and how often? (affected user segments)
      - Current workarounds and their costs (evidence of pain)
      - Business impact of not solving this (why it matters)
    elicit: true
    template: |
      {{problem_description}}

      **Who Experiences This:**
      {{affected_users_and_frequency}}

      **Current Pain Points:**

      **Current Workarounds:** {{workarounds_and_costs}}

  - id: business-context
    title: Business point of view
    instruction: |
      Explain the business impact and justify why this problem deserves the proposed appetite.
      Include current metrics, business costs, and strategic importance.
    elicit: true
    template: |
      {{business_impact_description}}

      **Appetite:** {{weeks}} weeks, {{people}} person(s) ({{total_hours}} hours maximum)

  - id: solution
    title: Solution
    instruction: |
      Create fat marker solution sketch. This should provide direction without constraining developer creativity.
      
      CRITICAL: Do NOT over-specify technical implementation. Focus on user flows and key elements.
    elicit: true
    sections:
      - id: goals
        title: Goals
        instruction: |
          Define what success looks like without prescribing how to achieve it.
          Focus on user outcomes and business objectives.
        type: bullet-list
        template: "- {{goal_statement}}"
      - id: details
        title: Details
        instruction: |
          Provide fat marker sketch of solution elements. Include:
          - Key user flows and interactions
          - Core elements that must exist
          - High-level approach without technical prescription

      - id: out-of-scope
        title: Out of scope
        instruction: |
          Define clear boundaries and "must nots" to protect appetite.
          Include explicit exclusions and scope protection mechanisms.
        sections:
          - id: explicit-no-gos
            title: Explicit No-Gos

  - id: analytics
    title: Analytics - Leading & Lagging Indicators
    instruction: |
      Define how we'll measure success using leading and lagging indicators.
      Follow the L&L framework for hypothesis-driven evaluation.
    sections:
      - id: lagging-indicators
        title: Lagging indicator(s) - Why?
        instruction: |
          Define the ultimate outcomes we want to achieve.
          These measure the business impact after implementation.
        type: bullet-list
        template: "- {{lagging_indicator}}"
      - id: hypothesis-evaluation
        title: Hypothesis & evaluation - How?
        instruction: |
          State your hypothesis about how the solution will create the desired outcomes.
          Define how you'll evaluate if the hypothesis is correct.
        template: |
          **Hypothesis:** {{hypothesis_statement}}

          **Evaluation Approach:**
          - {{evaluation_method_1}}
          - {{evaluation_method_2}}
          - {{evaluation_method_3}}
      - id: leading-indicators
        title: Leading indicator(s) - What?
        instruction: |
          Define the early signals that indicate the solution is working.
          These should be measurable soon after implementation.
        type: bullet-list
        template: "- {{leading_indicator}}"
      - id: preliminary-targets
        title: Preliminary targets
        instruction: |
          Set specific, measurable targets for both leading and lagging indicators.
          Include baseline measurements where available.
        type: bullet-list
        template: "- {{target_statement}}"
