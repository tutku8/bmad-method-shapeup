sections:
  - id: header
    title: Shape Up Pitch Header
    instruction: Create pitch title and summary based on discovery analysis
    elicit: false

  - id: problem_statement
    title: Problem
    instruction: |
      Craft compelling problem statement based on discovery analysis.
      Include who experiences this, current pain points, and evidence.
      Reference specific evidence from discovery phase.
      Keep focused on the validated problem, not solutions.
    elicit: true
    rationale_focus:
      - Is this problem statement compelling and evidence-based?
      - Are we staying solution-neutral in the problem description?
      - Does this clearly show why this problem deserves the appetite?

  - id: business_perspective
    title: Business Point of View
    instruction: |
      Present business case and stakeholder impact from discovery.
      Include strategic importance, costs of inaction, and competitive context.
      Reference appetite and explain why this investment makes sense.
      Connect to broader business goals and metrics.
    elicit: true
    rationale_focus:
      - Does the business case justify the appetite?
      - Are we connecting to measurable business outcomes?
      - How does this align with strategic priorities?

  - id: appetite_declaration
    title: Appetite & Circuit Breakers
    instruction: |
      Clearly state appetite from discovery phase.
      List circuit breakers that protect against scope creep.
      Explain what we're NOT willing to spend beyond this appetite.
      Make appetite constraints explicit and actionable.
    elicit: true
    rationale_focus:
      - Is our appetite realistic for this problem?
      - Are circuit breakers specific enough to be actionable?
      - What are we saying no to with this appetite?

  - id: solution_goals
    title: Solution Goals
    instruction: |
      Define high-level solution goals without prescribing implementation.
      Focus on outcomes and success criteria from discovery.
      Keep at the "what" level, avoid the "how" level details.
      Ensure goals align with appetite constraints.
    elicit: true
    rationale_focus:
      - Are these goals achievable within our appetite?
      - Are we staying at the right level of abstraction?
      - Do these goals address the core problem?

  - id: scope_boundaries
    title: No-Gos & Scope Boundaries
    instruction: |
      Define what we're explicitly NOT doing in this project.
      List features, integrations, or complexity areas that are out of scope.
      Reference circuit breakers from discovery analysis.
      Be specific about boundaries to prevent scope creep.
    elicit: true
    rationale_focus:
      - Are our boundaries clear and specific?
      - What scope creep risks are we protecting against?
      - Are we being realistic about what fits in the appetite?

  - id: success_metrics
    title: Analytics & Success Measurement
    instruction: |
      Define leading and lagging indicators from discovery analysis.
      Create hypothesis and evaluation methods.
      Set preliminary targets that align with business goals.
      Focus on metrics that validate problem-solution fit.
    elicit: true
    rationale_focus:
      - Are these metrics meaningful for the business case?
      - Can we actually measure these things?
      - Do our targets reflect appetite-appropriate ambitions?

  - id: deliverability_assessment
    title: Deliverability Assessment
    instruction: |
      Assess deliverability within appetite constraints.
      Reference risks and mitigation strategies from discovery.
      Consider technical complexity, team capacity, and dependencies.
      Provide confidence level for delivery within appetite.
    elicit: true
    rationale_focus:
      - Are we being realistic about deliverability?
      - What risks could blow our appetite?
      - How confident are we in this assessment?

  - id: betting_readiness
    title: Betting Table Readiness
    instruction: |
      Summarize why this pitch is ready for betting table consideration.
      Highlight appetite discipline, risk mitigation, and business impact.
      Reference competitive positioning and strategic value.
      Make the case for why this deserves a bet.
    elicit: false
    rationale_focus:
      - Is this pitch compelling for decision makers?
      - Have we addressed the key betting table concerns?
